# Mars-Perseverance-Rover-RaspberryPi5_32bit-

This project is an ongoing attempt to create a functional scale model of the NASA Perseverance Mars Rover. The objective is to replicate key mechanical and operational features using accessible components, custom 3D printed parts, and programmable control systems.

The rover model will include a motorised drivetrain designed to rotate the wheels independently. A camera model will be integrated into the system in order to capture images and transmit them for remote viewing. All functions - locmotion, camera activation and system control - will be operated wirelessly through a PlayStation 4 controller connected to a Raspberry Pi 5.
